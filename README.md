To create this site, we used javascript and jQuery for animation.
As you can see, we used a link to the latest version of jQuery. To create functions and localstorage, we used YouTube and https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript / this is the site. The design was not copied out of nowhere, a personal work in Figma. Our website was developed for a construction company that does apartment repairs. The problems were mostly when the code didn't work.
