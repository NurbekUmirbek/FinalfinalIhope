To create this site, we used javascript and jQuery for animation.
As you can see, we used a link to the latest version of jQuery. To create functions and localstorage, we used YouTube and https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-local-storage-with-javascript / this is the site. The design was not copied out of nowhere, a personal work in Figma. Our website was developed for a construction company that does apartment repairs. The problems were mostly when the code didn't work.

HTML and CSS
The first thing I did was to study the structure of our site, then I tried to comply with this structure, for this I made a header, then a main part and at the end a footer. I am telling all this in brief here, but I will try to explain it in full on the defense. I also added 2 animations, added a background, changed the font and everything using a link from Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/?hl=ru ). Added everything except media unfortunately.
